Scraper
=======

An DOMXPath wrapper and a cURL wrapper to reduce the amount of repetitive code that is needed when writing scrapers.

Goals for future releases :
- Make more descriptive exceptions.
- Write decent documentation.
- Unit testing.
- Feel free to intervene and fork if you have any ideas.
